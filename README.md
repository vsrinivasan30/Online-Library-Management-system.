Online-Library-Management-system.
=================================

This project of “ LIBRARY MANAGEMENT” of gives us the complete information about the library. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. In this project we can maintain the late fine of students who returns the issued books after the due date.  Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information and comments in an easy and intelligible manner. The project is very useful for those who want to know about Library Management System.  In the last, we gratefully acknowledge and express our gratitude to all staff members of PRS Computer and friends who supported us in preparing this project.
